# Data Analysis and Visualization of Pizza Store Sales Using Power BI

<p align = "center">In this data analysis and visualization project, we explore the sales data of a pizza store using a combination of SQL and Power BI. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how data analysis can be effectively performed by leveraging both SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization and insights generation. Through this project, we showcase the synergy between these two powerful tools in extracting valuable information from a real-world dataset.</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Extraction and Preparation: Access and clean pizza store sales data from a structured database using SQL queries.</li>
  <li>Data Analysis using SQL: Utilize SQL to aggregate sales, calculate trends, and segment customer orders, uncovering insights.</li>
  <li>Data Transformation and Modeling: Load SQL-transformed data into Power BI, shape it further, and establish relationships for visualization.</li>
  <li>Data Visualization with Power BI: Create dynamic visualizations using Power BI's tools to showcase sales trends, top products, and category distribution.</li>
  <li>Insights Generation: Extract valuable insights from visualizations, including seasonality patterns, popular categories, and customer behaviors.</li>
</ul>
